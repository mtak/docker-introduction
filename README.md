# docker-introduction

This repository contains the accompanying artifacts for the Docker introduction
course given at Liberty Global. 

Docker images can be found on Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/u/merijntjetak

Slides are available at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SJ35VUmPMcPKhVml04tImnKcE4hdpqtmcqUkXOk4u0k/edit?usp=sharing
and in the PDF in the repo.

The registry at tak.io was only active while the course was given. This part
of the exercise won't work. You can substitute with the https://hub.docker.com/_/registry
or Docker hub.
